# Module 1- Python For Linear Algebra
## 1.1 Pseudocode: the new language for algorithm design

Pseudocode is a way to describe algorithms in a structured but plain language. It helps in planning the logic without worrying about the syntax of a specific programming language. In this module, weâ€™ll use Python-flavored pseudocode to describe various matrix operations.

>**Caution**
There are varities of approaches in writing pseudocode. Students can adopt any of the standard approach to write pseudocode.

### 1.1.1 Matrix Sum
Mathematical Procedure: To add two matrices $A$ and $B$, both matrices must have the same dimensions. The sum  of two matrices  $A$ and $B$  and  is calculated element-wise:
 $$C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]$$

 1. Example: Let $A$ and $B$ be $2\times 2$ matrices given by:
  
    $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix}$$
    

2. Evaluate $\int\limits_0^\infty (x^2+y^2)dx$.
